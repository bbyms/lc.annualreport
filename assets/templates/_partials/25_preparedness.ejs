			Local responders and field-based initiatives are at the centre of the Logistics Cluster Preparedness Project, which has as its primary objective the strengthening and localisation of national humanitarian logistics. The project works collaboratively with national responders – government, non-government, academia and the private sector – to build sustainable outcomes based on a common, localised and autonomous approach. The project is intended as a catalyst, kick-starting a capacity-strengthening process which is then continued by other organisations once the Project ends.

			The Covid-19 pandemic threatened ongoing project activities and rollout planning, primarily through reduced access to key national stakeholders, understandably concerned with the immediate response activities, and the reduced ability of project staff to deploy and to interact with counterparts. In spite of this, the project took significant steps forward in 2020. Work commenced in an additional xx countries (Nepal, xxx); activities continued in most active countries – albeit with some delays.

			Looking first at the Asia-Pacific region: April saw Cambodia finalising the recruitment and deployment of a Preparedness Expert, who has since been advocating for an increased focus on logistics preparedness by national actors, and has supported them with stakeholder mapping activities and coordination mechanisms. In May, the Bangladesh National Humanitarian Logistics Action Plan, developed during the 2019 gap-analysis workshop, was endorsed by the NDMO (Ministry for Disaster Management and Relief). Discussions are underway with on next steps. Activities continued in Laos, led by the national Preparedness Officer. A ToR for a National Logistics Preparedness Working Group was developed and circulated to stakeholders, and is currently with the NDMO (Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare) for endorsement. The action plan, developed in 2019, was discussed by stakeholders in an NDMO-led workshop. Government officials were trained in warehouse management, and have since led the training of their colleagues across 18 provinces nationally. Work in the Philippines was significantly constrained due to covid-19-related lockdowns, and changes to key government staff. The national Preparedness Officer nevertheless was able to support the government for several natural disaster responses, and has continued to build relationships with key interlocuters. Recruitment of a Preparedness Expert for Nepal was completed in November, with deployment underway in January 2021. The planned start in Bhutan had to be postponed to 2021 due to government constraints on staffing. In the Pacific, as with previous years, preparedness localisation initiatives were undertaken under the lead of WFP, through the Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) cluster system.

			  Moving Africa and the Middle East: In Iraq, the project conducted a regional Gap Analysis Workshop in Erbil covering the Kurdish Region of Iraq at the beginning of 2020, to be followed by similar event in 2021 in Bagdad covering Federal Iraq in early 2021. These will result in a common roadmap covering the entire country. In Madagascar, the national logistics working group was actively involved in the coordination and response of the floods that affected the northern part of the country. The project has continued to support the NDMO (BNGRC – Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes) with its prepositioning strategy. This strategy proved critical in 2020, with the country affected by floods in the north and drought in the south. Throughout the year, the project has been working with the BNGRC to fully transition the project to the Government and ensure sustainability. The Malawi Ministry of Transport and Public Works – the lead for the national logistics sector – endorsed the Action Plan developed during the 2019 Gap Analysis Workshop, and stakeholders started implementation of the action plan’s activities. In Mozambique, a Provisional Logistics Working Group was established in Pemba in the Capo Delgado province. This was followed by a Gaps Analysis Workshop conducted in the same province with the provisional authorities and humanitarian actors. A Plan of Action of the National Logistics Preparedness project was approved by the INGC (INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE GESTÃO DE CALAMIDADES) directorate. National and provisional level logistics working groups were merged into a single national logistics sector working group under the leadership of INGC in order to improve coordination. South Sudan’s scaleup of the project from the EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) preparedness to national logistics preparedness was put on-hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project instead focused on supporting the humanitarian community with COVID-19 preparedness and response. Since the project commenced in Zimbabwe at the beginning of 2020, a Logistics Preparedness Working group has been established, a Gap Analysis Workshop conducted, and an Action Plan developed by the working group has been endorsed by the Department of Civil Protection. Kenya, Tajikistan, and Sierra Leone were identified as candidate countries in early 2020 by the Logistics Cluster Preparedness Working group. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rollout of the project in these countries has been delayed by eight months. In December 2020, the NDMOs in the three countries endorsed the implementation of the project in their respective countries. The project is planned to be rolled out in early 2021 across the three countries, with Tajikistan likely to commence in late January.

			In the Americas: 2020 marked the start of Preparedness activities in the Americas despite the severe impact of COVID-19 and Hurricanes Eta and Iota in candidate countries. At the beginning of year, a scoping mission was conducted in Colombia to officially start the project. A few months after, the Preparedness Expert started chairing the Logistic Working Group focussing on transitioning from response coordination to preparedness activities in 2021. In Haiti, Preparedness activities resumed through the deployment of a Preparedness Expert who has been actively engaged in starting to transition the work of the Logistics Sector to a Preparedness Working Group in coordination with the NDMO (DGPC). Later in the year, the Regional Preparedness Officer for the Americas started developing a regional strategy and engaging with key actors to ensure the scope of the Project is tailored to the realities of the region where the private sector is strong and the primary need is to focus on building long-lasting relationship between different stakeholders. In the last months of 2020, Honduras and Guatemala host organisation officially accepted to initiate the Project in 2021 in the framework of the response transition and lessons learned from Eta/Iota Hurricanes.

			At the global level, two major milestones were achieved in 2020. First, for Log:IE - an information exchange platform for logistics preparedness, readiness and response coordination and information sharing. The platform supports the humanitarian supply chain through timely provision of logistics information. It is anticipated to be rolled out to the targeted field preparedness countries for 2021, based on a ‘Minimum Viable Product’ that has been developed and tested in eight different countries as pilot phases.

			Second, a detailed Institutional Capacity Strengthening Framework was finalised. This framework, built on a foundation of detailed guidance documentation and templates, aids officers in taking a sustainable approach to capacity strengthening and activity monitoring at the country level. Adopting a consistent set of metrics, while still remaining flexible across a wide range of country contexts, allows a global picture of the project’s contribution to increased localisation to be defined. The framework, and the lessons learned during its implementation in upcoming countries in 2021, will form the core of the Project’s other global deliverable, the Preparedness Guide.  As this approach is rolled out to new project countries in 2021, the supporting capacity strengthening documentation will be updated to reflect experiences and lessons learned. This will form the core of the project’s global-level deliverable, the Preparedness Guide, which aims to support other global partners as they undertake capacity strengthening activities, in line with the grand bargain agreements to support localisation of activities.
