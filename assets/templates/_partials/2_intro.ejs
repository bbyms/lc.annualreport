      <h1 class="title">The Logistics Cluster</h1>
      <p class="serif">enables global, regional, and local actors to meet humanitarian needs. Before crises, we work with stakeholders globally and in high-risk countries and regions to strengthen local logistics capacities. In crises, where these capacities have been exceeded, we provide leadership, coordination, information, and operational services. </p>
      <p class="serif">Globally, the Logistics Cluster is a community of partners actively working to overcome logistics constraints, and to develop and share best practices and solutions. </p>
      <p class="serif">The cluster approach was adopted in 2005 as a result of the Humanitarian Reform process launched by the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). The reform process focused on strengthening coordination and accountability, and enhancing partnerships in key sectors, including logistics. </p>
      <p class="serif">Because of its expertise in humanitarian logistics and its operational capacity, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) was chosen by the IASC to be the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster. In this role, when necessary, WFP acts as a provider of last resort, offering common logistics services to all humanitarian responders. </p>
      <p class="serif">The Logistics Cluster leverages its network of active partners to best fill critical logistics gaps. When local infrastructure is severely damaged or inaccessible and local capacities have been exceeded, the Logistics Cluster facilitates access to common assets and services to humanitarian responders, enabling them to reach affected populations.  </p>
      <p class="serif">The Logistics Cluster is key to ensuring an efficient humanitarian crisis response, reducing duplication of efforts and enabling a faster intervention. </p>
